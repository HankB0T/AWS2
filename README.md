Certainly! Here's a concise step-by-step guide to implement an AWS Lambda function with an S3 trigger:

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
- Navigate to the Amazon S3 console.
- Create a new bucket named `techu-bucket1`.

### Step 2: Prepare the Lambda Function
- Write your Lambda function code and save it as `lambdaTemplate.yaml`.
- Ensure that this file is a valid YAML file and contains the necessary code to process S3 events.

### Step 3: Create IAM Role and Policy
- Go to the AWS IAM console.
- Create a new role named `lambda-s3-trigger-role`.
- Attach a policy named `s3-trigger-policy` with the following permissions:
  - **CloudWatch Logs**: Write access to create and manage logs.
  - **S3**: Read access to read objects from S3 buckets.

### Step 4: Create the Lambda Function
- Open the AWS Lambda console.
- Click on "Create function" and select "Author from scratch".
- Set the name of the function to `s3triggerlambda`.
- Choose the runtime that matches your code.
- Under permissions, select the `lambda-s3-trigger-role` created earlier.

### Step 5: Configure the S3 Trigger
- In the Lambda function configuration, click on "Add trigger".
- Select S3 from the list of available triggers.
- Configure the trigger with the following settings:
  - Bucket: `techu-bucket1`
  - Event type: `PUT`
  - Prefix and suffix as needed to match `lambdaTemplate.yaml`.

### Step 6: Verify the Function and Permissions
- Upload `lambdaTemplate.yaml` to `techu-bucket1`.
- Check the CloudWatch Logs to verify that the Lambda function executed correctly.
- You should see an entry stating "Content Type: application/x-yaml" confirming the function's success.

This guide assumes you have the necessary AWS permissions and that the AWS CLI is configured on your machine. Remember to replace any placeholders with your actual resource names and details. Happy coding! ðŸš€.
